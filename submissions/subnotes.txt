submission 44 - 0.68870
=======================
this is submission 42 with notebooks/ellipse_clean post-processing

NOTE
====
There is an error in the fcnn code used for a lot of previous submission :

	# upsample the classif map
	x = merge([
		UpSampling2D((2, 2))(outmap4),
		UpSampling2D((4, 4))(outmap5),
		pool3
	    ], mode='concat', concat_axis=1)
	x = Convolution2D(16, 3, 3, border_mode='same')(pool3)

The conv layer should take x, not only pool3 as input
